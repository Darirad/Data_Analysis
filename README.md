This Python code automates the conversion of a linear peptide topology file (generated by Gromacs) into a topology file suitable for a cyclic peptide simulation. It allows you to perform energy minimization on the cyclized peptide and obtain a new PDB file.

**Features:**

* Reads a linear peptide topology file (`.itp`) generated by Gromacs.
* Modifies the topology to connect the termini of the peptide for cyclization.
* Writes a new topology file (`.itp`) compatible with Gromacs for a cyclic peptide.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3 (tested with version 3.12)

**Usage:**

1. **Save your linear peptide topology file (`.itp`) and PDB file (`.pdb`) in the same directory as this script.**
2. **Run the script from the command line:**

```
python peptide_cyclizer.py
Enter the name of the topology file: <linear_peptide_topology.itp>
Enter the name of the new topology file: <output_cyclic_peptide_topology.itp>
```

- Replace `<linear_peptide_topology.itp>` with the actual filename of your linear peptide topology file.
- Replace `<output_cyclic_peptide_topology.itp>` with the desired filename for the output cyclic peptide topology file (optional, defaults to 'cyclized.top').

3. **The script will generate a new topology file (`.top`) for the cyclic peptide.** You can use this file along with your original PDB file for energy minimization with Gromacs software.

**Example:**

```
python peptide_cyclizer.py
Enter the name of the topology file: my_peptide.itp
Enter the name of the new topology file: cyclized.itp
```

This command will read the file `my_peptide.itp`, modify it for a cyclic peptide, and create a new file named `cyclized.itp`.

**Additional Information:**

* This script assumes a specific format for the Gromacs topology file. Modifications might be needed for different file structures.
* The script currently performs basic cyclization by connecting the termini. More complex modifications might require adjustments to the code.
